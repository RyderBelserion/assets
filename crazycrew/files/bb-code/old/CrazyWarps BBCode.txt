[COLOR=#4da6ff]Welcome to the Category Warps plugin. With this plugin, you can create warps and add them to categories. You can make a category called Prison and add all of you prison warps to it so it looks much nicer than random warps everywhere.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#a64dff]Please review this plugin to tell me what you think of it. If you run into any bugs please do put it in a review but instead please put it in the discussions tab so I can fix the problem <3.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#ff4d4d]This plugin overrides all of the Essentials commands and does not import any essentials warps and will have to put all warps back.
[/COLOR]
[SIZE=5][COLOR=#00b359]Commands:[/COLOR][/SIZE]
[COLOR=#0080ff]/WarpHelp - Lists all of the Warp Commands.
/WarpList - Lists all of the warps in their categories.
/Warp <Warp Name> - Warps the player to the warp they desire to go.
/SetWarp <Category> <Warp Name> - Sets the warp in its category.
/DelWarp - Removes the warp from the server.
/WarpReload - Reloads the Config.yml.[/COLOR][/FONT]

[FONT=Georgia][SIZE=5][COLOR=#59b300]Permissions:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]
[COLOR=#0080ff]CategoryWarps.WarpHelp - /WarpHelp
CategoryWarps.<CategoryName> - Allows players to view the warps in that category in the WarpList.
CategoryWarps.<CategoryName>.<WarpName> - Allows players to warp to those warps.
CategoryWarps.WarpList - /WarpList
CategoryWarps.Warp - /Warp
CategoryWarps.SetWarp - /SetWarp
CategoryWarps.DelWarp - /DelWarp
CategoryWarps.Reload - /WarpReload[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#b3b300]As seen if you have the permission CategoryWarps.WarpList then you can see the categories but it says "You do not have permission to see these Warps!" as seen on line 4. if you have permission to that category then you can see the warps but they will be red meaning you don't have permission to use that warp as seen in line 3. if you have permission to that warp then it will turn gold as seen on line 2. This is all configurable the messages and what color they are in the Config.yml
